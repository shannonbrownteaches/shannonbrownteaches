                Jump on in, and join us! My classroom climate is warm, welcoming and fosters a strong community of care and respect. As a teacher, I believe the most important part of my job is developing strong, supportive relationships with students and parents. I want all my students to succeed. Having open and honest communication with the student and parent is key.  From voicing our ideas about service projects to reflecting on our STEAM projects, this classroom promotes a safe space that is responsive to one’s culture, language and background. Most importantly, your voice is always heard! I plan morning meetings, predictable routines and procedures because this enables children to feel empowered and be in control of their own learning experiences. This also promotes student engagement and they are more willing to take risks and try new things in their learning experiences. From collaborating with others to build a kite to writing an independent short story about animals, students are always up and moving around! Flexible seating helps me achieve this goal in creating a comfortable space that is customizable to the student’s learning preferences. Giving students the option to choose a seat that allows them to work best gives them more control and maximize their learning potential.

                To maintain the classroom community, I implement a positive classroom management system to amplify learning time. Students will make mistakes. Students will fail again, and again. It is natural and negative choices do need to be addressed when necessary. However, focusing on the positive actions and nurturing a growth mindset will allow the classroom climate to become more encouraging and supportive. Some examples of this include:

                <li>Star system - children can earn their stars for different behaviors they need to improve on. Every two weeks, the students are able to cash in their stars for different kinds of rewards.

                <li>
                    Voice level - this reminds students how to act appropriately during an activity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Student of the Week- I focus on one student who has made many strides and has shown significant growth in leadership, behavior, social and academic goals.

                Implementing these classroom management procedures set high expectations for my students and maximizes our learning time. Check out the photos to get a sense of our community!
