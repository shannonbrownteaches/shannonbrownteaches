                <li>Utilizing the Night Sky App to augment reality to help students identify stars, planets, constellations and satellites in real time </li>
                <li>Coding and designing a pathway with Dash and Dot so robots can safely follow a path of sequenced steps to avoid bumping into hazardous objects </li>
                <li>Differentiating math and reading skills with XTRA math and reading A-Z to practice building fluency</li>
                <li>Collaborating and Communicating information through flipgrid, quizlet live, kahoot, peardeck..etc. </li>
                <li>Exploring excel by following a code to color in cells to reveal a hidden picture </li>
                <li>A google expedition to a safari by augmenting reality for students to compare and contrast animal features, habitats and eating habits</li>
