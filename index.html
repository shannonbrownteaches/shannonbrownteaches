            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Shannon Brown and I am in my second year of teaching first grade. I graduated from DeSales University with a Bachelor’s degree and certification in Early Childhood and Elementary Education. In my classroom, I implement a variety of teaching strategies to accommodate different styles of learning.  I take a creative approach with my instruction and utilize whole brain learning to give my students the opportunity to collaborate with each other and develop strong leadership skills. I am passionate and very dedicated to helping my students reach their goals both inside and outside the classroom.

            <h1>Why I Became a Teacher</h1>
            <p>
                My decision to become an educator is grounded in my aspiration to inspire others and to make a difference. The most important quality of an effective educator is caring for all students and making them feel appreciated and that their voices are heard. As a teacher, I serve as a positive influence in my student’s lives, and I have a direct influence on how they view the world around them, and how they view themselves. My mission is to teach students how to become independent problem solvers by modeling good examples of leadership, work ethic, and teaching them the importance of caring for one another by respecting all things and people. Every child has a unique vision, and it is important that children learn how to collaborate and communicate their ideas in an effective manner so their thoughts and actions can have a positive impact on society.

            <h1>Welcome to the place...</h1>
            <p>
                The place where reading comes alive through room transformations, flip-grids, book tastings, and readers theater performances! The place where technology enhances our ability to make connections and augment reality to bring learning experiences to us. The place where students can research prehistoric life and also code the next future program for your smart device. The place where students learn the importance of patience, courage, perseverance and the qualities of effective leadership. The place where friendships form over shared colored pencils and erasers. The place where students will always remember who believed in them and encouraged them to succeed. Take a look at our learning experiences, in the magical place we are proud to call our classroom.
