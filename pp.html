            <h1>Planning and Preparation</h1>
            <p>
                Failing to plan means planning to fail. When it comes to planning and preparing for instruction, I am very detail oriented when it comes to time, materials and meeting the instructional outcomes. I always prepare additional resources in case I need to differentiate the lesson, dive deeper into discussion or if unpredictable classroom events happen! Taking the time to reflect after a lesson by simply writing down what went well and what I need to improve on has helped me recognize my strengths and areas of growth as a professional educator.

                I utilize the Backward Design Process when creating my unit and weekly plans. I align my goals and objectives with the PA state standards and curriculum guidelines determined by the school.  I identify the desired results by developing my goals around the enduring understandings. I then choose an appropriate assessment tool and modify it so all my learners can demonstrate their understanding. I believe it is important to develop a wide range of assessment tools which allow children to demonstrate their multiple intelligences. My assessments include: presentations, videos, tests, projects, observations, reflections and journals. Then, I guide my students throughout the learning process through questioning techniques and modeling. I pair my instruction with meaningful hands on learning experience geared toward my students interests.

                In order to achieve my desired results, I  implement many collaborative learning activities so my students can develop their critical thinking skills, interpersonal skills and make discoveries about various topics. The independent projects allow students to focus on their own ideas and gives them time to develop strong work ethic skills so they can meet their goal.

                            Every week I allow students to apply their skills in a hands on word work center. Depending on the week, students have the option to: bead their words, stamp their words, write in different utensils, create word searches, brain teasers, and secret codes. These activities allow students to manipulate the letters to grasp a better understanding and become more familiar with word patterns.
